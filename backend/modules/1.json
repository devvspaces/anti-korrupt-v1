  "overview": "This guide was co-drafted by the members of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) YouthLED Integrity Advisory Board (2021-2023). The Board was established by UNODC in 2022, operating within the framework of the Global Resource for Anti-Corruption Education and Youth Empowerment (GRACE) initiative. The Board is composed of 25 young people from 25 countries, who recognized the need to share \"insider knowledge\" because starting anti-corruption work was often difficult.",
  "objectives": [
    "Collect and collate simple and easy-to-use tips so that more young people can gain knowledge about anti-corruption.",
    "Make anti-corruption work more accessible to peers by demolishing barriers to youth engagement and participation.",
    "Target young people who have little or no knowledge about corruption or the work of the United Nations but are interested in becoming active in their community, region, or internationally by building their own anti-corruption initiative.",
    "Inspire and encourage young people with the belief that a better future infused with integrity is possible"
